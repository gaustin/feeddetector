Modification of the feed detector done by http://dominiek.com/articles/2007/6/22/detecting-atom-rss-feeds-in-ruby.

Basically it returns all the feeds that it find not just one...

Usage:

FeedDetector.fetch_feed_urls('http://www.rubycorner.com')

returns:

["http://www.rubycorner.com/feeds/updated/atom10", "http://www.rubycorner.com/feeds/updated/rss20"]

TODO:
* Decouple parsing and retrieving data.
* Tests should not depend on data retrieved from the web taking a particular form.
